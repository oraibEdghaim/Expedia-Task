Firstly i tested the GitHub technology with one of may php application and depoly it in the heroku cloud platform to 
be familiar to me 

secondly  i tested  the api with some parameters to show the recieved information from the api , 
i used the java language (servlet and jsp) which i deal  with it previously java script , jquery ,bootstrap and css to handle the Ui functionality and design for  my application 

I learned a lot of things like  how i can raed and parse json objects into java , using the gson library which is helped me 
by usiing their functionality  

I just have less than 3 months experiance period with java web and the javaScript , jQuery and bootsrap
